## Getting Started

<details>
<summary>Expand to view setup instructions</summary>

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergehall/Python_SMC_CS_87A
cd Python_SMC_CS_87A
```

### 2. **Install Python**

Ensure you have Python **3.10+** installed.

```bash
python3 --version
```

If not installed (macOS via Homebrew):

```bash
brew install python
```

### 3. **Run assignments**

Each assignment can be run individually.  
Some require data files (`house.tab` and `president.tab`) to be present in the same directory.

Example:

```bash
cd "Home work"
python3 A05.py
python3 A06.py
```

> **Note:** Tkinter is required for `A06.py`.  
> On macOS, install with:
> ```bash
> brew install python-tk
> ```

</details>

## A06 – Tkinter GUI Demo

The final assignment (`A06.py`) creates a desktop application that:

- Loads parsed election data from `A05`’s helper functions
- Lets the user select year/state and type of chart
- Draws bar charts on a Tkinter `Canvas`
- Includes **Draw**, **Clear**, and **Quit** buttons

---

## Data Files

Two `.tab` files are included for assignments 5 and 6:

- **house.tab** – House of Representatives election results
- **president.tab** – Presidential election results

These are tab-delimited text files used by the parsing functions.
